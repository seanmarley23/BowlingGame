JavaScript Bowling Scorecard

A player can bowl once or twice per frame, with 10 frames per round. 
A strike (all 10 pins knocked down with first throw of frame) and a spare (all 10 pins knocked down in one frame) will award added bonuses.
There are 10 frames in a round (approx 20 throws if no strike/spare is awarded).
This is a scorecard for one person to use to keep track of their final score.
